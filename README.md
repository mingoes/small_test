# Small Test

A small test to demonstrate some skills.

## Intro

For the small test there where no clearly defined conditions so I made it for "modern" browsers. Basically Chrome or Safari should be fine.

## Stack

For the stack I decided for a simple webpack and babel setup together with highcarts, lodash and papa parse (for csv).

## Setup

Setup is simple by doing:
```
yarn
```

followed by

```
yarn start
```

This will open a new browser window with webpack-dev-server
