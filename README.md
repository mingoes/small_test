# Small Test

A small test to demonstrate some skills.

## Intro

For the small test there where no clearly defined conditions so I made it for "modern" browsers. Basically Chrome or Safari should be fine.

## Stack

For the stack I decided for a simple webpack and babel setup together with highcarts, lodash and papa parse (for csv).

## How to view

The best way is to setup the project (easily) and push the buttons to see everything in action.
For just code review the best place to start is in the index.js (most code is there). Because I used good (builtin) libraries there are not so many lines of code.

## Setup

Setup is simple by doing:
```
yarn
```

followed by

```
yarn start
```

The small-test case can then be viewed at: http://localhost:8080/
